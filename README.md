# Zomato-Analysis-using-Py-Libraries
This project involves analyzing Zomato data using Python to extract meaningful insights. We leverage libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. The analysis covers key trends, distributions, and relationships within the dataset to aid decision-making.

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations (Heatmaps, Bar Charts, etc.)
- Insights on Restaurant Types, Locations, Ratings, and Online Order Availability

## Tools and Libraries Used
- NumPy: For numerical computations
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- Seaborn: For creating attractive and informative statistical graphics
- Matplotlib: For generating plots and data visualizations

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install the required Python libraries using:
